<p> 
Life Sciences and Engineering Center of NJIT is the hallmark facility of the latest design, which has a vital role in enhancing life science and engineering education and research. The building is a design that stimulates colleagues working together across departments, addressing more complex scientific and engineering problems.
<br><br>
While this center houses efficiently advanced laboratories with special technologies for biomedical engineering, molecular biology, chemical process research, it creates an environment where faculty-student experimental work will extend in areas like tissue engineering, drug delivery, development of biomaterials, and approaches to environmental sustainability.
<br><br>
Other educational areas in the building comprise lecture halls and classrooms for participatory learning. This facility also houses collaboration areas scattered all over the facility so that student-researcher-industry partners will converge.
<br><br>
There is a component of sustainability in the design of this center because the building utilizes energy- and eco-friendly systems and materials. Such credibility confirms NJIT's commitment to the environment through an upscale research house with a low carbon footprint.
<br><br>
Through moving innovation ahead, the LSEC will provide students with new avenues toward jobs in emerging fields, along with helping to advance healthcare and technology. These are highly interdisciplinary concerning research and considerations for sustainability. Hence, they form a major plank in NJIT's portfolio as global missions through science and engineering.
