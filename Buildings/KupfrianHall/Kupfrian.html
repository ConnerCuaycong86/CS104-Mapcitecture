    Kupfrian Hall is one of the significant academic buildings on the New Jersey Institute of Technology campus in Newark, New Jersey. It predominantly houses classrooms, lecture halls, and laboratories that support numerous academic programs, especially within the engineering and science programs. The building serves as an important space for learning, research, and innovation-a mimesis of NJIT's mission to provide quality education and advance technology.

    The facilities within Kupfrian Hall have been designed to accommodate a wide range of activities by students and faculty alike. This includes special labs that are fully equipped with state-of-the-art equipment for practical experiments and projects that the students undertake. These are highly useful in subjects such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science, which require much hands-on work to supplement the theoretical courses.
