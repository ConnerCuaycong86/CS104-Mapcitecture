<p>
    This is true about Faculty Memorial Hall- the real and historically important structure on NJIT grounds. Functioning as a nexus of academic and administration, it captures the previous traditions of the university and the aspirations of its changing future. Centrally located on the NJIT campus, the building serves as another focal point at times for both students and faculty.
<br><br>
Faculty Memorial Hall is in that it borrows some of the academic traditionalism of architectural form: to evoke a sense of history and legacy. In name, honor accorded to those faculty members who have contributed greatly in shaping the university. Within it are classrooms where students learn in diverse areas, and faculty offices that would serve as rooms for mentorship and collaboration. Meeting rooms for discussion, seminars, and small events are also available; it sustains the intellectual vitality that the school generates through NJIT events.
<br><br>
Beyond functionality, Faculty Memorial Hall stands for the future of NJIT as a strong institution of education and research. It reminds the campus community of the institution's overarching commitment to an environment that is rich in opportunities for learning and innovation. For many in the NJIT community, this building becomes both a bridge to traditions and a future foundation.
