    <p>With Construction commencing in 1911, Colton Hall remains one of New Jersey Institute of Technology, NJIT`s, oldest buildings featuring great historical significance. Structurally, it was designed and built as a factory, displaying characteristics of early industrial design of the 20th century that included well-built structures with high ceilings 14 feet in height that aimed at housing machines and production activities. The stress was on the materials and wide spaces as the linchpin of the building while showcasing Newark’s industries.
    <br><br>
    This building was given the name of Mr. Charles A. Colton who was the first director of the Newark Technical School which was later ennobled NJIT. Colton was remarkably involved in the formation of the school’s mission paying special attention to the provision of vocational education and training that met the needs of the developed industries of the region.
    <br><br>
    Presently, Colton Hall has a different role as classrooms, offices, and labs are housed there, which show how NJIT actual works. The fundamental five stories building is quite integral to the history of the university as it links its industrial past with present dual focus on RD, and provision of the greatest. Other aspects of the building which are intact include, architectural aspects such as high ceilings and strong building structure are still eliminating such limit.
