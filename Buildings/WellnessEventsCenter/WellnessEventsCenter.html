    The WEC on the NJIT campus is the latest addition, offering one of the best modern settings that serves as the center for health, wellness, athletic activities, and events conducted on campus. Opening in 2017, the WEC speaks to the commitment at NJIT for promoting physical fitness, community involvement, and school spirit. With its innovative design and adaptable spaces, it has grown to be an epicenter of student and faculty/staff life and engagement, as well as guests.
<br><br>
The WEC spans 220,000 square feet and includes a variety of amenities to suit different needs. The facility boasts a 10,000-seat arena that acts as the home court for NJIT's Division I athletic teams in basketball and volleyball. It also hosts major events such as commencement exercises, concerts, and conferences, making it a focal point for both the university and the larger community.
<br><br>
Apart from its arena, the WEC has multi-functional recreational and fitness areas. It has a several-tiered workout area with cardiovascular and weight-lifting machinery, indoor track lanes, and rooms for group aerobic activities like yoga and Zumba. The center has multi-purpose courts, an aquatic pool, and dressing rooms to further support students and staff in keeping fit.
<br><br>
As a venue for wellness, the WEC hosts health fairs, stress-relief activities, and wellness workshops, promoting a holistic approach to student life. Its role extends beyond athletics, serving as a community hub that fosters engagement, collaboration, and personal growth.
