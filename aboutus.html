<h1>Meet Our Team</h1>

<h2 class="name">Conner Cuaycong</h2>
<p>Conner Cuaycong is a student at NJIT, majoring in Architecture. Born and raised in Denville, New Jersey, he has two younger twin brothers who are six years his junior. Currently, Conner commutes to NJIT during the school year while pursuing his passion for design and creativity.  
    <br><br>
    From a young age, Conner has been fascinated by observing the work of others and creating projects of his own. His early interests ranged from sketching cars inspired by real-life designs to constructing architectural models during high school. His creative inclinations also extend to music, as he plays multiple instruments, including the violin, drums, and guitar—teaching himself the latter two in his spare time.  
    <br><br>
    During high school, Conner immersed himself in architectural studies, taking three related courses: CAD 1, CAD 2, and Architecture. What began as a schedule filler with CAD 1 quickly became a discovery of his passion for modeling structures, designing floor plans, and sketching conceptual ideas. His enthusiasm led him to double up on CAD 2 and Architecture in his following year, dedicating three and a half hours daily to architectural projects.  
    <br><br>
    In these classes, Conner designed a range of structures, including a music store specializing in guitars and records, a chalet-style house set in the mountains, and a collaborative downtown area comprised of stores designed by classmates. These experiences solidified his love for architecture and creative design.  
    <br><br>
    Conner first learned about NJIT’s architecture program through his high school CAD/Architecture teacher, who recommended it as a strong option for pursuing his interests. Presentations from former students about CAD-related majors—ranging from Civil Engineering to Architecture—helped Conner identify his path. A presentation by an NJIT representative on the university’s Architecture program sealed his decision.  
    <br><br>
    Looking ahead, Conner plans to become a licensed architect and aims to secure an internship during his sophomore or junior year at NJIT. His long-term goal is to establish his own architectural firm, where he hopes to bring his creative vision to life and contribute meaningfully to the field of architecture.</p>
<h2 class="name">Nikoloz Rukhadze</h2>
<p>Nikoloz Rukhadze, who goes by Nick, is a passionate student originally from Georgia, a small country in Europe—not to be confused with the U.S. state of the same name. He moved to New Jersey about a year ago to pursue his education and dreams. From a young age, Nick has been deeply fascinated by architecture, often marveling at how humans create complex and beautiful structures. Whenever he and his family went out, he would study buildings closely, sketching them and imagining how he might design or reconstruct them differently.  
<br><br>
    Nick’s inspiration is rooted in the architectural landscape of his home country, which features many Soviet-era buildings. His dream as an architect is to use the skills he will gain over the next five years to transform and reconstruct those structures, giving them new life. This goal drives his determination to learn and grow as a designer.  
    <br><br>
    During high school, Nick actively sought out opportunities to expand his knowledge, taking every available course in art and design to deepen his understanding of architecture. His travels to countries like Belgium and France further enriched his perspective, exposing him to unique architectural styles and reinforcing his belief that architecture is a powerful way to express a country’s identity and culture.  
    <br><br>
    Nick views architecture not just as a profession but as an integral part of life. He recalls advice from his father, who once told him that to be a successful architect, one must have a broad and diverse knowledge base. Nick wholeheartedly agrees, emphasizing that architects should not only master drawing and design but also explore fields like history, business, and even astronomy. For him, architecture is the art of creating something new and unique, and this requires constant learning and inspiration.  
    <br><br>
    However, Nick also recognizes the importance of balance. He believes that to be truly creative, architects need to step away from their work, relieve stress, and enjoy life. This balance, he feels, allows for clearer thinking and more innovative ideas.  
    <br><br>
    Nick’s philosophy on architecture is rooted in both passion and practicality. He acknowledges that the field can be challenging and stressful, but he firmly believes that it’s essential to embrace the joys of life alongside hard work. In his view, architecture is not just about building structures—it’s about building a life full of purpose, creativity, and fulfillment.</p>
